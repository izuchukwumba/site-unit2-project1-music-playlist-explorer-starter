### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Add your response here: Yes it did

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Add your response here: I would have made a more appealing UI, implemented the Edit feature and optimized some added features.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Add your response here:
Some of my peers build faster and so were able to complete all stretch goals. I will try this approach for next week and make sure all goals are done.
